Create Folder of Element Name in \Steps\Elements\
Go to Directory \Steps\Helpers\Classes\
Copy the File OldStepHelper.cs
Rename it by replacing Old with your Element name (capital for start of words), remove the " - Copy"
Open the newly renamed file (check it is the right file, VS has a habit of openning the OldStepHelper)
Replace Old with your Element Name (capital for start of words, exactly as in the file name) - should be 3 - do not worry about errors at this point
Save <ElementName>StepHelper.cs
Open the file StepHelpers.cs (note the plural)
Starting at line 24, find the line public IOldStepHelper Old { get; private set; }
Copy this and paste it alphabetical to where your new element will sit
Replace the Old with the name of your new Element
In the method InitializeHelpers()
Find the line Old = new OldStepHelper(featureContext, targetForms); in the InitializeHelpers Method, and copy it
Paste it back in the same method, in alphabetical order where your new element will be found.
Replace the Old with your new element name in the line you just pasted in - again ignore red errors
Save file
Go to Directory \Steps\Helpers\Interfaces
Copy the File IOldStepHelper.cs
Rename the copied file, replace Old with your new Element Name (capital for start of words)
Open the newly rename file (again confirm VS is tricky)
Replace the IOldStepHelper (will be red underlined) with I<ElementName>StepHelper
Open the File IStepHelpers.cs (note the plural)
Copy the line IOldStepHelper Old { get; }
Paste it in the same method alphabetically where the new element will site
In the pasted line replace the Old with ElementName (x2)
Save File

Confirm no more red lines (build solution)

When you require a Steps/Element (given, when and then) - Copy from another
